          <p class='poem-copy'>Exquisite corpse—<i>cadavre exquis</i>
            if you're nasty—is a parlor game developed by French surrealists in the
            early 20th century. The idea is that a group of people play together to
            build a collage of images or, as is the case here, words: a poem with many
            poets. Each person takes turns writing a line, building on the lines that
            came before. Welcome to the world's biggest, never-ending game
            of exquisite corpse.</p>
