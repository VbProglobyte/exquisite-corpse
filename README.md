## User Story & Description 
```
AS A [possibly frustrated] writer, I WANT TO work on poems with other writers SO THAT I can write compelling poetry and have fun doing it.
This is a collaborative writing app inspired by the surrealist parlor game, in which a group of people take turns crafing a poem. Users will sign in and either create a new poem or add to an existing one.
